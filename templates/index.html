            <p>Taking you a stage further in your {{ drill.type }} drill, I am now going to teach you {{ drill.lesson }}. The reason this movement is taught is to allow you as an individual or formed body of men to {{ drill.reason }} in a smart, soldier-like and uniform manner.</p>
            <p>On the word of the command 'STAND - EASY', relax and look this way for a full demonstration of the movement.</p>

            <p>There you saw a complete demonstration of the movement. For the purpose of instruction, this movement can be broken down into parts, each part being numbered.

            <p>[Inspect the class individually, critiquing and correcting as necessary, and telling them to break off as you pass each pair.]</p>
            <p>[Once all of the class has broken off to practise, move between pairs (or groups if an uneven number) and critique further.]</p>
