# drill-phraseology
A tool that creates full drill phraseology based on the drill lesson of choice. This is to aid the tuition of British Army drill.
The idea is that you will be able to choose a drill lesson from a drop-down menu and that the template of drill phraseology will be filled in with the relevant words of command, points to note, etc.
